        The pH solving is done using a simple minimization algorithm which
        minimizes the difference in the total positive and negative ion

        adjusted using the `method` keyword argument. The available methods
        can be found in the documentation for the scipy.optimize.minimize

        A good initial guess may help the minimization. It can be set manually
        using the `guess` keyword, which defaults to 7.0. There is an
        automated method that can be run as well if you set the `guess_est`
        argument. This will override whatever you pass is for `guess`. The
        `est_num` keyword sets the number of data points that you'd like to
        use for finding the guess estimate. Too few points might start you
        pretty far from the actual minimum; too many points is probably
        overkill and won't help much. This may or may not speed things up.

        Parameters
        ----------

        guess : float (default 7.0)

        guess_est : bool (default False)

            pH of the solution. This may or may not slow down the calculation
            of the pH.

        est_num : int (default 1500)
            The number of data points to use in the pH guess estimation.
            Ignored unless `guess_est=True`.

        method : str (default 'Nelder-Mead')
            The minimization method used to find the pH. The possible values
            for this variable are defined in the documentation for the
            scipy.optimize.minimize function.

        tol : float (default 1e-5)
